# Hotel-Booking-Analysis

Project Overview :

This project analyzes booking cancellations at City and Resort Hotels to identify factors driving cancellations and recommend strategies to reduce them. Key findings show that higher prices, longer waiting lists, and offline travel agent bookings contribute to cancellations. We used data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to uncover insights. Recommendations include dynamic pricing, targeted discounts, seasonal campaigns, and service improvements. These strategies aim to lower cancellations, increase revenue, and enhance hotel operations. ðŸš€
